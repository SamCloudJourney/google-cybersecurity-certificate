## Course 2: Play It Safe – Manage Security Risks

This course explores how cybersecurity professionals manage security risks, apply frameworks, and use tools to detect, respond to, and recover from incidents.

## Module 1: Security and Risk Management

### 1. Security and Risk Management

Focus: Establish a security strategy and align it with business operations.

- Define goals to protect critical assets like PII.
- Use risk mitigation to reduce the impact of threats.
- Align with compliance requirements to shape policies.
- Develop business continuity and disaster recovery plans.
- Follow legal and ethical practices to prevent negligence and abuse.

### 2. Asset Security

Focus: Manage and protect physical and digital assets.

- Secure data during storage, transfer, retention, and destruction.
- Apply policies for data classification and access control.
- Identify and monitor who has access to sensitive data.

### 3. Security Architecture and Engineering

Focus: Build systems with layered security controls.

- Apply secure architecture principles during system design.
- Promote shared responsibility for security across the organization.
- Encourage reporting and awareness of potential threats.

### 4. Communication and Network Security

Focus: Protect data during transmission and network communication.

- Secure data in transit over internal, cloud, and remote networks.
- Restrict risky behavior over public networks (e.g., Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
- Use network access controls to limit exposure.

### 5. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

Focus: Manage access to resources.

- Grant only necessary access using the principles of least privilege.
- IAM components:
  - Identification: Who you are.
  - Authentication: Verifying your identity.
  - Authorization: What you're allowed to access.
  - Accountability: Logging user actions.

### 6. Security Assessment and Testing

Focus: Evaluate existing controls and identify improvements.

- Perform audits and assessments to detect weaknesses.
- Analyze data for threats and vulnerabilities.
- Improve controls (e.g., enforce MFA).

### 7. Security Operations

Focus: Respond to incidents and manage active threats.

- Apply incident response processes to contain attacks.
- Use digital forensics to investigate incidents.
- Implement lessons learned to prevent recurrence.

### 8. Software Development Security

Focus: Secure software throughout its lifecycle.

- Use secure coding practices from design to deployment.
- Conduct secure design and code reviews.
- Perform application-level testing to identify vulnerabilities.

## Threats, Risks, and Vulnerabilities

### Threat

Definition: A circumstance or event with the potential to negatively impact an asset.

Example: Phishing, ransomware, social engineering.

### Risk

Definition: The likelihood that a threat exploits a vulnerability and affects confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

- Low-risk: Public web content.
- Medium-risk: Internal documents.
- High-risk: PII, SPII, intellectual property.

### Vulnerability

Definition: A weakness that can be exploited by a threat.

Examples: Outdated firewalls, weak passwords, unpatched software, human error.

## Risk Management

### Key Strategies

- Acceptance: Acknowledge the risk but take no action.
- Avoidance: Eliminate the risk entirely.
- Transference: Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., cyber insurance).
- Mitigation: Reduce the likelihood or impact.

### Risk Management Frameworks

**NIST RMF** – 7 steps:

1. Prepare
2. Categorize
3. Select
4. Implement
5. Assess
6. Authorize
7. Monitor

**HITRUST** – Common in healthcare for managing compliance and risk.

## Cybersecurity Frameworks and Controls

### What Are Frameworks?

- Structured guidelines for managing risk, threats, and compliance.
- Help build, monitor, and improve security programs.

Notable examples:
- NIST CSF and RMF
- Cyber Threat Framework (CTF)
- ISO/IEC 27001
- HIPAA, GDPR, PCI-DSS

### What Are Controls?

- Safeguards that reduce risk.
- Types:
  - Physical (locks, security guards)
  - Technical (MFA, firewalls, antivirus)
  - Administrative (policies, role-based access)

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework – 5 Core Functions

1. Identify: Understand assets and risk.
2. Protect: Implement preventive controls.
3. Detect: Recognize security incidents.
4. Respond: Contain and resolve incidents.
5. Recover: Restore systems and operations.

## OWASP Security Principles

- Minimize Attack Surface Area
- Principle of Least Privilege
- Defense in Depth
- Separation of Duties
- Keep Security Simple
- Fix Issues at the Root
- Establish Secure Defaults
- Fail Securely
- Don’t Trust External Services
- Avoid Security by Obscurity

---

## Security Audits

- Independent review of security controls and compliance.
- Assesses effectiveness of practices and reveals risks.
- Informed by internal policies and external regulations.
- Common frameworks: NIST CSF, ISO 27001

---

## SIEM and SOAR

### SIEM Tools (Security Information and Event Management)

- Collect and analyze log data.
- Detect anomalies and alert analysts.
- Examples: Splunk, IBM QRadar, Chronicle

### SOAR Tools (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response)

- Automate incident response tasks.
- Reduce manual effort and response time.

---

## Cybersecurity Playbooks

- Documented procedures for responding to security incidents.
- Include response steps, communication plans, and containment strategies.
- Help ensure consistent, lawful, and timely actions.

Common phases:
1. Preparation
2. Detection
3. Analysis
4. Containment
5. Eradication
6. Recovery
7. Post-Incident Review
