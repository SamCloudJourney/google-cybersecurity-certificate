# Google Cybersecurity Certificate – Course 1: Foundations of Cybersecurity

---

## Module 1: What is Cybersecurity?

### What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, programs, and data from:
- Unauthorized access
- Damage
- Disruption
- Criminal exploitation

Cybersecurity relies on the **CIA Triad**:
- **Confidentiality** – Only authorized users can access the data
- **Integrity** – The data is accurate and unaltered
- **Availability** – The data is accessible to those who need it, when they need it

### Goals of Cybersecurity

- Protect people and systems from cyber threats
- Safeguard sensitive data and business operations
- Prevent unauthorized access and data breaches
- Maintain trust with users, customers, and stakeholders

### Types of Threats

- **External Threats** – Hackers, cybercriminals, advanced persistent threats (APTs)
- **Internal Threats** – Disgruntled employees, careless users, or contractors

### Benefits of Strong Cybersecurity

- Prevents attacks and data breaches
- Protects internal and external assets
- Helps organizations remain compliant with laws and regulations
- Maintains operational continuity
- Reduces financial and reputational damage

### Cybersecurity Analysts

Analysts are responsible for:
- Monitoring systems and networks
- Investigating incidents
- Responding to threats
- Installing and configuring prevention tools
- Using tools like SIEM, IDS/IPS, antivirus, and vulnerability scanners

### Key Skills

- **Technical Skills** – Knowledge of networks, systems, tools
- **Soft Skills** – Communication, collaboration, analytical thinking, problem-solving, attention to detail

### Organizations That Need Cybersecurity

- Government agencies
- Healthcare providers
- Financial institutions
- Retail and e-commerce
- Any organization that handles sensitive data

## Module 2: Common Threats and Social Engineering

### Common Types of Malware

- **Malware** – Malicious software designed to damage or gain unauthorized access
- **Viruses** – Attach to clean files; require user action to spread
- **Worms** – Spread automatically across networks without user interaction
- **Ransomware** – Locks data or systems and demands payment for restoration

### Social Engineering Attacks

- **Phishing** – Fake emails to steal information
- **Spear Phishing** – Targeted phishing at specific individuals
- **Whaling** – Spear phishing aimed at executives
- **Vishing** – Phone calls that attempt to extract information
- **Smishing** – Text messages that lure users into clicking malicious links
- **Business Email Compromise (BEC)** – Attacker impersonates trusted individual

### Psychology Behind Attacks

Attackers exploit:
- Curiosity ("You won a prize!")
- Fear ("Your account is locked!")
- Urgency ("Respond immediately")
- Trust ("I’m from IT")

### Other Threats

- **Insider Threats** – Employees or ex-employees misusing access
- **External Threats** – Outside attackers
- **Threat Actor** – Any individual or group carrying out an attack

### SIEM and Threat Detection

- **SIEM** – Collects and analyzes logs from multiple systems
- Detects abnormal activity, correlates data, and alerts analysts

## Module 3: Frameworks, Controls, and Compliance

### Purpose of Frameworks

Frameworks help organizations:
- Protect personal and financial information
- Identify weaknesses
- Respond to business crises
- Manage cybersecurity risk
- Align security with business goals

### Key Terminology

- **CIA Triad** – Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- **Security Frameworks** – Structured plans for managing security
- **Security Controls** – Specific safeguards against risk
- **Security Architecture** – Design of systems and defenses
- **Security Governance** – Policies and decision structures
- **Compliance** – Adherence to regulations and standards
- **Security Ethics** – Making responsible decisions with access and information

### Common Frameworks and Regulations

| Framework / Law | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| NIST CSF | US cybersecurity framework |
| FERC-NERC | Secures power grid systems |
| FedRAMP | Secures cloud services for federal use |
| CIS Controls | General best practices |
| GDPR | Protects personal data in the EU |
| PCI DSS | Secures credit card data |
| HIPAA | Secures healthcare data in the US |

### PII and Data Privacy

- **PII** – Identifying personal data (e.g., name, ID)
- **SPII** – Sensitive personal data (e.g., biometrics, finances)
- **PHI** – Protected health information under HIPAA
- **Privacy Protection** – Ensuring personal data isn’t exposed or misused

### Additional Terms

- **Asset** – Anything of value (data, systems, people)
- **Hacktivist** – Hacker motivated by political or social causes

## Module 4: Tools for Protecting Business Operations

### SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)

| Feature | Function |
|---------|----------|
| Log Aggregation | Collects data from systems and apps |
| Alerting | Warns of suspicious activity |
| Dashboards | Visualizes event data |
| Hosting Options | Cloud or on-premise |

Examples: Splunk, IBM QRadar, ArcSight, Graylog

### Network Protocol Analyzers (Packet Sniffers)

Tools for inspecting data traveling over the network.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Wireshark | Visual interface for packet-level analysis |
| tcpdump | Command-line traffic capture tool |

### Security Playbooks

Predefined guides for analysts to follow during incidents.

- **Chain of Custody** – Tracks who accessed evidence and when
- **Preserving Evidence** – Follows the "Order of Volatility":
  1. RAM
  2. Network traffic
  3. Running processes
  4. Disk storage
  5. Backups

### Analyst Tools and Categories

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| SIEM | Splunk, QRadar |
| Packet Analysis | Wireshark, tcpdump |
| Endpoint Protection | CrowdStrike, Defender |
| Asset Management | Lansweeper |
| Forensics | Autopsy, FTK Imager |
| Identity Management | Okta, Active Directory |
| Encryption | VeraCrypt, BitLocker |

### Programming for Analysts

| Language | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Python | Automation and scripting |
| SQL | Querying data from logs/databases |

- **Database** – Organized data collection
- **Data Point** – One individual record within a database

### Operating Systems and Linux

- **Linux** – Command-line based, open-source operating system
- Used heavily in security environments for scripting, forensics, and automation

### Web Vulnerabilities

Web apps can have flaws that allow attackers to:
- Access unauthorized data
- Inject malicious code
- Steal sessions or credentials

Resource: OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities list

### Encryption Concepts

- **Plaintext** – Unencrypted, readable data
- **Ciphertext** – Encrypted, unreadable without a key
- **Encryption** – Secures data from unauthorized access
- **Encoding vs. Encryption**:
  - Encoding = Data formatting (not secure)
  - Encryption = Data protection (secure)

---

### Summary Takeaways

- Analysts must understand networks, tools, systems, and human behavior
- SIEM, IDS, antivirus, encryption, and automation are critical tools
- Knowledge of Linux and programming increases analyst effectiveness
- Well-handled evidence and playbooks are essential for proper investigations
- Cybersecurity skills are valuable across every industry
